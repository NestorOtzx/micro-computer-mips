2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[3] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[4] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[5] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[6] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_RX/word_signal_tmp__0[7] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell U_RX/word_signal_tmp_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
